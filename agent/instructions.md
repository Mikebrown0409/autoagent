# Instructions

Create a simple Python script called `hello.py` in the workspace root that:
1. Prints "Hello, World!" to the console
2. Has a main function
3. Uses proper Python structure with `if __name__ == "__main__"`

This is a simple test to verify the agents can create code files in the workspace.
