### Tasks Generated:
- Create a new file named `test_output.txt` in the current agent directory.
- Write the string "System test successful - " followed by the current timestamp into `test_output.txt`.
- Use a standard timestamp format such as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (e.g., via Python's `datetime` module or shell `date` command).
- Ensure the file contains exactly one line with the complete text.
- Commit the new file with a message like "Add test_output.txt with system test confirmation"....

### Implementation Summary:
**Summary:** I created a temporary Python script to generate the current timestamp and write the required string to `test_output.txt`. Executed the script to create the file, then removed the script. The file now contains exactly one line with "System test successful - " followed by the timestamp in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format. The changes will be committed automatically with a descriptive message....
