### Tasks Generated:
- Confirm `hello.py` exists in workspace root with correct structure: `def main(): print("Hello, World!")` and `if __name__ == "__main__": main()`
- Verify `README.md` exists with "# Hello World" title and description of the hello.py script
- Test script execution: run `python hello.py` and confirm output is exactly "Hello, World!" with no extra text or errors
- If README.md missing or incomplete, create/update it with: "# Hello World", script purpose, and "Usage: python hello.py" section
- Add ...

### Implementation Summary:
Based on the history and repository state, hello.py likely exists with the correct structure but without the shebang. README.md exists but may need updating to match "# Hello World" exactly and include the usage section.

From history, it has "# Hello World Script" or similar, but task specifies "# Hello World". Update to match.



Run the te...
