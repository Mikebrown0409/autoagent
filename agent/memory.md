### Tasks Generated:
- Verify `hello.py` in workspace root contains exactly: `def main(): print("Hello, World!")\nif __name__ == "__main__": main()`
- If `hello.py` differs, overwrite with precise content:
```
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
- Execute `python hello.py` in workspace root and confirm output is exactly "Hello, World!" with no extra text or errors

- Add to ...

### Implementation Summary:
From the commands, I checked the content of hello.py, which was already correct. I ran python hello.py and confirmed the output was exactly "Hello, World!" with no errors. I checked README.md and found it needed completion, so I overwrote it with the full explanation including overview, functionality, and the specified usage section. Finally, I staged and committed the changes with the required message....
