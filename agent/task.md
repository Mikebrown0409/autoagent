- Confirm `hello.py` exists in workspace root with correct content: `def main(): print("Hello, World!")` and `if __name__ == "__main__": main()`
- If `README.md` exists, verify it explains the hello.py script, its structure, and execution
- If `README.md` is incomplete or missing, create it with: title "# Hello World Script", description of functionality, main function explanation, proper structure details, and run instructions (`python hello.py`)
- Test execution: run `python hello.py` and verify output is exactly "Hello, World!\n" with no errors
- Add all changes to git staging: `git add hello.py README.md`
- Commit with message: "Complete hello.py implementation with comprehensive README.md"
