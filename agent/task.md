- Confirm `hello.py` exists in workspace root with exact content: `def main(): print("Hello, World!")` followed by `if __name__ == "__main__": main()`
- If `hello.py` missing or incorrect, create/overwrite `hello.py` in workspace root with exact content above
- Test run `python hello.py` and verify output is exactly "Hello, World!" with no extra text or errors
- If test passes, stage file with `git add hello.py`
- Commit with message: "Add hello.py with main function printing Hello, World!"
- Verify git status shows clean working directory (no uncommitted changes in root)
- Run `python hello.py` one final time to confirm functionality
- Document success in a new file `README.md` in workspace root with: "# Hello World App\nSimple Python script that prints 'Hello, World!' using main() function."
