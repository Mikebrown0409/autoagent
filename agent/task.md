- Verify `hello.py` exists in workspace root and contains exactly: `def main():\n    print("Hello, World!")\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    main()`
- If `hello.py` is missing or has incorrect content, create/overwrite it with the exact structure above
- Test `hello.py` by running `python hello.py` in the workspace root and capture output
- Confirm test output exactly matches "Hello, World!" (ignoring any extra whitespace/newlines)
- If test fails, debug and fix `hello.py` to ensure it prints correctly
- Create `README.md` in workspace root with content: "# Hello World\n\nA simple Python script that prints 'Hello, World!' using a main function and proper if __name__ guard."
- Verify all files are correctly formatted and committed with message "Complete hello.py implementation with README"
