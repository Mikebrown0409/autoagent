- Confirm `hello.py` exists in workspace root with correct structure: `def main(): print("Hello, World!")` and `if __name__ == "__main__": main()`
- Verify `README.md` exists with "# Hello World" title and description of the hello.py script
- Test script execution: run `python hello.py` and confirm output is exactly "Hello, World!" with no extra text or errors
- If README.md missing or incomplete, create/update it with: "# Hello World", script purpose, and "Usage: python hello.py" section
- Add shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python3` as first line of `hello.py` for better portability
- Commit changes with message "Complete hello.py with README and testing"
- Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -5` to verify clean repo state and recent commits
