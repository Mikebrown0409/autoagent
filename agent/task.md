- Verify current contents of `hello.py` exactly match: `def main():\n    print("Hello, World!")\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    main()`
- If `hello.py` does not exist or contents mismatch, overwrite with exact code above
- Run `python hello.py` and capture console output
- Confirm output is exactly "Hello, World!" (ignoring trailing newline/whitespace)
- If output incorrect, debug `hello.py` and fix to ensure precise printing
- Add shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python3` as first line of `hello.py`
- Create `README.md` explaining the script's purpose and usage
- Commit changes with message "Finalize hello.py with verification and README"
