# Hello World Script

This repository contains a simple Python script called `hello.py` that demonstrates a basic "Hello, World!" program in Python.

## Script Overview

The `hello.py` script is designed to print the text "Hello, World!" to the console when executed. It follows good Python practices by organizing the code into a `main()` function and using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard to ensure the script runs only when executed directly (not when imported as a module).

## Structure

- **main() function**: This function contains the core logic of the script, which is a single `print()` statement outputting "Hello, World!".
- **Execution guard**: The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block calls the `main()` function, preventing it from running if the file is imported elsewhere.

The script is kept minimal with no imports, comments, or extra whitespace for simplicity.
