# Hello World Script

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Python script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. The script is structured with a `main()` function to demonstrate good programming practices, such as using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard. This ensures the script can be run directly or imported as a module without executing the main code unintentionally.

## Functionality
- The `main()` function contains a single `print()` statement that outputs "Hello, World!".
- The script uses the standard Python idiom `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` to call the `main()` function only when the script is executed directly, not when imported.
- When run, it produces exactly the output "Hello, World!" followed by a newline, with no extra text or errors.

## Usage
Run: `python hello.py`
